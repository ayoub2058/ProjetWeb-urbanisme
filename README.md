Clyptor Web Application - Setup Instructions

1. DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT
- Download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.

2. RUN THE APPLICATION
- Since this is a frontend-only version, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
- No server setup is required as all data is stored in the browser's localStorage.

3. ADMIN ACCESS
- An admin account is automatically created:
  Email: admin@clyptor.com
  Password: admin123
- You can access the admin dashboard by logging in with these credentials and clicking the "Admin" link.

4. USING THE APPLICATION
- Register new accounts to access all features
- Create posts in any of the three services
- Test the admin functionality by managing users, posts, and messages

5. LIMITATIONS
- This is a frontend-only demo. In a production environment:
  - You would need PHP/MySQL or another backend system
  - Image uploads would need server-side processing
  - Authentication would need proper security measures
  - Data would persist across browsers/devices

6. BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- May have limited functionality on Safari or mobile browsers due to localStorage limitations
